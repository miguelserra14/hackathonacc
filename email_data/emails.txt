Thanks for sharing your thoughts. The design team has reviewed them.
We agree on the need for better template navigation and are already exploring some concepts.
For real-time preview, we have a few ideas to improve performance and accuracy.
Simplified export options also make sense. Perhaps a user-configurable default?

Subject: Query: CVGeneration PDF library options
Body:
Hi,

I'm working on the PDF export module for CVGeneration and encountering some limitations with the current library for complex layouts.
Do you have any recommendations for alternative Java PDF libraries that offer more flexibility, particularly with CSS-like styling or absolute positioning?
Any pointers would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Dev Team Member, CVGeneration

Hi,

Hope you're having a good evening.
The marketing team is planning a new campaign and we were wondering if there's a way to pull some anonymized usage statistics from Locklinked via an API (e.g., number of active users, popular features).
Could you let me know if this is feasible and who we should talk to on the Locklinked team?

Subject: Discussion: CVGeneration - Caching strategy for templates
Body:
Hi team,

As we add more complex templates to CVGeneration, the initial load time for the template selection screen is increasing.
I think we should discuss implementing a more robust caching strategy, perhaps pre-rendering thumbnails or caching frequently used templates on the client-side.
Tech Consultant, do you have any best practices or preferred approaches for this kind of scenario?
Maybe we can add this to the agenda for the next sprint planning.

Thanks,

Body:
Team, Consultant,

Following up on the user reports of Locklinked sluggishness (forwarded by support).
Initial diagnostics show a spike in read operations on our primary database instance starting around 05:00 WEST.
This coincides with a new marketing analytics query that was scheduled to run. We suspect this query might be inefficient.
We've temporarily disabled the query and are seeing performance recover.
Tech Consultant, could you take a look at the query logic (I'll send it separately) and suggest optimizations?
We need to ensure our analytics don't impact user experience.

Thanks,
