Subject: Initial thoughts on CVGeneration v2 UI
X-Priority: 3 (Normal)

Hi team,

Following up on our earlier discussion, I've jotted down some initial thoughts for the CVGeneration v2 UI refresh.
Key areas to consider:
1.  Improved template navigation.
2.  Real-time preview enhancements.
3.  Simplified export options.

Could you share your preliminary feedback by EOD Thursday?

Best,
Project Lead CVGen

Olá,

Espero que esta mensagem o encontre bem.
Tenho uma pequena dúvida sobre a secção 3.2 da proposta para o Project Phoenix que nos enviou. Poderia clarificar o cronograma para a fase de testes?

Obrigada,
